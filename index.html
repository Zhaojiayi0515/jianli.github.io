              <br/>This study focuses on investigating the factors that influence user experience for Beijing Mobile users. By using Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, the study examines various factors that impact user satisfaction and ratings, providing a basis for decision-making. Additionally, an XGBoost prediction model is developed based on the relevant influencing factors to predict customer ratings.

              <b>‚ÄúSmall-Batch Material Production Scheduling based on Time Series Forecasting and Inventory Management.‚Äù</b>
              <br/>This study focuses on materials production planning for an electronics manufacturing company in China. The research first identifies six key materials, classifying them into ABC categories based on demand and cumulative sales. An ARIMA model is used for weekly predictions, with satisfactory results, although some errors are noted. The study then improves the prediction accuracy using a BP neural network. A production plan is calculated for one selected material for weeks 101 to 110, achieving a service level of 99.28%. The study then addresses the balance between inventory level and service level considering price fluctuations, using an ABC inventory management system. Finally, a generalized production planning method is established through training models, which can sacrifice service level to some extent to reduce inventory cost when necessary.
              <br/>Keywords: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (AIRMA); BP Neural Network; Inventory Management; Demand Forecasting; Production Scheduling.
